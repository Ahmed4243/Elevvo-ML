# 🧮 Task 1 – Student Score Prediction

### 📊 Description
Predict students’ exam scores based on their study habits and lifestyle factors using linear regression.

### ⚙️ Steps
- Loaded and explored the *Student Performance Factors* dataset.
- Cleaned missing values and encoded categorical data.
- Visualized relationships like hours studied vs exam score.
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model to predict scores.
- Evaluated performance with R² and Mean Squared Error.

### 💡 Bonus
- Tried **Polynomial Regression** for better fitting.
- Compared models using different feature combinations (e.g., sleep, participation).

### 📈 Result
The model was able to estimate exam scores fairly accurately, showing how strongly study hours and motivation influence performance.
